My Kitties love this flavor the best and I am so pleased with the high quality ingredients, sustainable sourcing practices and all around best kibble out there! My kitties are older cats but their fur is soft and shiny and they are super healthy and active - I know this great nutrition has a lot to do with that!(Dave Bryson)
This kibble has excellent taste appeal and nutritive value. My four cats love it!(Ben Hadley)
Thanks for your great product. My kitties are happy, and I am very happy to be supporting a product and company that is better for our planet. Thanks for making it easier to do the right thing!(Steve Miller)
